Instructions for lesson 4-1 (Optional)
Fork the repository
The first step is to fork the source repository in GitHub and then clone your forked repository to your local development system. There are instructions for forking a repository in GitHub here: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo

Once you have it cloned locally make sure that the application runs by running the following commands if you are using yarn:

If you are using npm just replace yarn with npm and run the same commands.

yarn install
yarn test
Familiarize yourself with the code
When you run the yarn test or npm test command it will use the Jest test runner to execute the tests in the index.test.js file. You should see 3 failing tests at this point (one is only passing by coincidence otherwise there would be 4). Take a few minutes to look over the output from the test runner because it is very useful in debugging why the tests are failing.

After each set of changes to the code you should run the test script again to see if the test results have changed.

Jest also support running in a watch mode that will watch the files under test for changes and rerun the tests when it detects the changes. To do this you can use the script target from the package.json file of test:watch. To run that script using yarn do yarn test:watch. To run that script with npm do npm run test:watch. Note the extra run text from the previous version for the npm command. If you use the watch script then you don't need to run yarn test at the end of each section because it will already be running.

If you want to attempt this on your own without a step by step walkthrough then leave the section below collapsed.

//Fixing the fahrenheitToCelsius function
[x] Open the index.js file and find the fahrenheitToCelsius function.
[x] There are two main bugs in this function. It is returning the wrong variable and it is not assigning the result of the computation to the new variable.
[x] Change the return value from degreesFahrenheit to degreesCelsius.
[x] Assign the result of the calculation to the degreesCelsius variable.
[x] Run yarn test to verify that the tests for this function are now passing.
//Fixing the celsiusToFahrenheit function
[x] Open the index.js file and find the celsiusToFahrenheit function.
[x] The bug in this function is subtle and could be easy to miss, but looking at the output from the test running should help point out what is wrong.
[x] The return value has a typo in the variable name. Change it to the correct variable name.
[x] Run yarn test to verify that the tests for this function are now passing.
//Writing tests for getFirstStringFromArray
//There are 4 tests for this function. One of the tests has already been written to provide an example, but you will need to write the content for each of the 3 remaining tests.

[x] Using the 'Returns the first item if it is a string' as an example write the test logic for the 'Returns null for an empty array' test. You should pass in an empty array [] to the function for this test.
[x] Using the 'Returns the first item if it is a string' as an example write the test logic for the 'Returns null if no strings are in the array' test. Pass in an array containing only numbers for this test.
[x] Using the 'Returns the first item if it is a string' as an example write the test logic for the 'Returns the second item if the first item is a number' test. Pass in an array with a number followed by a string for this test.
